## Abstract
The rapid development of dynamic scene generation technology based on 3D representation has provided possibilities for data generation in many applications.
The generation of realistic rockfall videos can provide valuable and effective data sources for rockfall detection in key areas.
Based on existing researches, this paper proposes a rockfall video generation framework with 3D Gaussian Splatting and physical simulation.
This framework uses Structured Scenario Splatting to complete the scene modeling suitable for simulation, solving the negative impact of the large scale of real scenes and the complexity of the background area on the physical simulation stage.
Our method provides an effective exploration for the generation of data that conforms to physical laws in real scenes.
